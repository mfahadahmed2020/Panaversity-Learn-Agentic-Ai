cd 01_ai_agents_first/07_model_settings/hello_agent

Install dependencies:

uv add openai-agents

Run the learning examples:

python main.py

📚 What You'll Learn

This module teaches you how to fine-tune your AI agents using Model Settings:

    Temperature: Control creativity vs. precision

    Tool Choice: Decide when agents can use tools
    
    Max Tokens: Control response length
    
    Combining Settings: Create specialized agents

🎯 Learning Progression

    Start Simple: Temperature settings (creativity control)
    
    Add Tools: Tool choice settings (when to use tools)
    
    Control Length: Max tokens (response size)
    
    Master It: Combine multiple settings

🧪 Examples Included

    Temperature Experiment: Compare cold vs. hot agents
    
    Tool Choice Demo: Auto vs. required vs. none
    
    Length Control: Brief vs. detailed responses
    
    Combined Settings: Specialized math tutor
    
    Interactive Experiment: Try your own settings

💡 Key Concepts

Temperature (The Creativity Knob)

    Low (0.1-0.3): Precise, consistent answers

    Medium (0.4-0.6): Balanced responses
    
    High (0.7-0.9): Creative, varied responses

Tool Choice (The Tool Switch)

    Auto: Agent decides when to use tools
    
    Required: Agent must use tools when available
    
    None: Agent cannot use tools (chat only)

Max Tokens (The Length Limit)

    Low (50-100): Brief, concise responses
    
    Medium (200-500): Detailed explanations
    
    High (1000+): Comprehensive answers

🎓 Tips for Success

    Start with defaults: Don't change settings unless needed
    
    Test one setting at a time: See the impact of each change
    
    Document your experiments: Keep notes on what works
    Consider your use case: Different tasks need different settings
