  Streamed Agent Output Examples

  This README demonstrates how to implement and interpret streamed output from agents using Python's asynchronous features and the hypothetical agents library.
  Example 1: Streamed Agent with Tool Calls

  This example shows how an agent utilizes asynchronous tools to perform tasks dynamically.
  Code Overview

    Agent: Defined with specific instructions and tools.
    Tool: how_many_jokes, returns a random integer determining the number of jokes.
    Runner: Executes agent actions asynchronously and streams events.

    Explanation of Events

    tool_call_output_item: Shows the tool's returned data.
    message_output_item: Contains the generated messages by the agent.

  Key Concepts

    Streaming Output: Real-time responses from asynchronous agent executions.
    Event Handling: Filtering and processing streamed events for specific outputs.
    Agent Tools: Modular functions called by agents during tasks.

  Best Practices

    Clearly separate logic for handling different event types.
    Ensure asynchronous methods (async/await) are used properly.
    Provide user-friendly outputs by ignoring non-relevant event types (e.g., raw event deltas).

    This guide will help developers efficiently implement and interpret asynchronous, streaming AI agents for various applications.
