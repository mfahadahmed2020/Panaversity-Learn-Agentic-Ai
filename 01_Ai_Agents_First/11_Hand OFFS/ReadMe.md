Handoff

https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/

In the OpenAI Agents SDK, handoffs enable an agent to delegate tasks to another agent, facilitating specialized handling of different tasks within a multi-agent system. This mechanism is particularly useful when different agents possess expertise in distinct domains. citeturn0search2

1. Understanding Handoffs

Handoffs allow an agent to delegate tasks to another agent. This is particularly useful in scenarios where different agents specialize in distinct areas. For example, a customer support application might have agents that each specifically handle tasks like order status, refunds, or frequently asked questions.

2. Creating Agents

Define agents with specific roles and instructions.

Examples

3. Implementing Handoffs

To enable an agent to delegate tasks to another agent, define handoffs during the agent's creation.

Examples

In this setup, the triage_agent can delegate tasks to either the billing_agent or the refund_agent based on the user's request.
4. Running the Agent Orchestration

Use the Runner to execute the agent workflow.

Examples

In this example, the triage_agent assesses the user's input and delegates the task to the appropriate specialist agent.

Note:

Triage AI agents are artificial intelligence systems designed to assess, categorize, and prioritize tasks, ensuring that the most critical issues receive immediate attention. By automating the initial evaluation process, these agents enhance efficiency and accuracy across various sectors. How to pronounce:

5. Advanced Handoff Customization

For more control over handoffs, utilize the handoff() function to customize behavior.

Examples


In this scenario, the triage_agent uses a customized handoff to the refund_agent, allowing for specific configurations during the delegation process.
6. Conclusion

Implementing handoffs in the OpenAI Agents SDK enhances the modularity and specialization of your AI agents, enabling them to delegate tasks efficiently. By following this tutorial, you can create a multi-agent system where each agent operates within its domain expertise, leading to more efficient and effective task management.
