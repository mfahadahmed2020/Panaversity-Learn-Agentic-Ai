 





Certified Agentic AI & Robotics Engineer (CAARE): Program Guide
 Version: 3 (September, 2025)
Introduction
Artificial intelligence and robotics are reshaping every industry. Organizations require professionals who can design, build, and deploy autonomous software agents and physical robots that operate reliably, securely, and at scale. The Certified Agentic AI & Robotics Engineer (CAARE) program provides a comprehensive, multi‑level curriculum designed to equip engineers with these skills.
The AI Revolution is Here: The Future Belongs to the Architects of Intelligence
The demand for elite AI talent has skyrocketed, creating unprecedented opportunities for skilled engineers. Companies are investing billions not just in technology, but in the human minds that can harness its power. We are very lucky to be living in the age of AI. The following real-world examples illustrate the immense value and potential of a career in Artificial Intelligence.


The New Reality of AI Talent & Innovation
⦁	The $250 Million Offer: Meta successfully recruited a 24-year-old Ph.D. dropout, Matt Deitke, with a staggering $250 million package after an initial $125 million offer was declined.
⦁	The $1.5 Billion Rejection: Andrew Tulloch, co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab, rejected a six-year, $1.5 billion personal compensation package from Meta, shortly after the company's failed $1 billion bid for his startup.
⦁	The $250 Million Startup Acquisition: The two-year-old Generative AI cybersecurity startup, Prompt Security, was acquired by SentinelOne for $250 million in cash after having raised only $23 million.
⦁	The $3.1 Billion Valuation: AI sales-automation platform Clay raised $100 million in a funding round led by Alphabet’s CapitalG, rocketing its valuation to $3.1 billion—more than double its worth just three months prior.
⦁	The $2.4 Billion Talent Acquisition: Google licensed technology from Windsurf for $2.4 billion, bringing its CEO and R&D team to Google DeepMind to advance its AI ambitions.
⦁	The $500 Billion Valuation: OpenAI is negotiating a share-sale round that would value the company at $500 billion, surpassing SpaceX and demonstrating the immense financial race to secure and retain top AI talent.
⦁	The Rise of the 20-Something Founders: A new wave of young entrepreneurs is flocking to San Francisco to launch AI startups, with figures like Alexandr Wang (Scale AI) becoming multi-billionaires and Chief AI Officers before the age of 30.
These figures surpass the earnings of most elite athletes and Fortune 500 CEOs. The message is clear: the race for AI dominance is more intense than ever, and the future belongs to those who can build and master intelligent systems. 

Your Path to Becoming an AI Leader
Our Certified Agentic AI & Robotics Engineering (CAARE) Program is an intensive, hands-on journey designed to forge the next generation of AI pioneers. We focus on the next wave of AI—Agentic AI and Robotics—moving beyond foundational knowledge to build practical, real-world expertise.
This is not just a certification; it's an interactive career pathway with continuous feedback on your progress. The program is structured into four distinct levels, with exams conducted online via a fixed, proctored schedule.

Agentic AI Strategy for Pakistan
Premise: Pakistan must place smart, early bets on agentic AI as we train millions of developers and launch new ventures. Our strategy rests on four working hypotheses:
⦁	Agentic AI is the trajectory.
 AI is moving from chat to outcome-oriented agents that plan, use tools, and take actions. This guides our curriculum, tooling, and venture pipeline.

⦁	Cloud-native foundations win.
 Kubernetes plus Dapr (Actors, Workflows, Agents) and Ray provides the scalable, observable, resilient base for distributed agent systems.

⦁	The learning gap is the bottleneck.
 Most failures stem from weak workflow design, integration, and governance—not model capability. We will close this gap with hands-on training, playbooks, guardrails, and ROI-first delivery.

⦁	The web is becoming agentic and interoperable.
Open protocols—MCP (capability discovery/context), A2A (authenticated agent-to-agent), and NANDA (identity/authorization/audit)—enable composable automation across apps, devices, and clouds. The browser shifts from “tabs” to an outcome orchestrator.

Execution Pillars:
⦁	Talent engine: workforce development in agentic patterns, workflow design, and safety.
⦁	Reference stack: production blueprints on K8s + Dapr + Ray with observability and cost controls.
⦁	Standards readiness: MCP/A2A/NANDA-aware architectures.
⦁	Measure & adapt: publish results, iterate, and reallocate based on evidence.








Certification Overview
 
In our program we use these building blocks to develop Planet Scale AI Agents. 
The certification program consists of four levels, each with specific exams tailored to different expertise levels, exams are conducted online, on a fixed schedule, and are proctored:
